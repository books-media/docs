SQL DB - probably postgres

Java back-end - use Spring

Angular front-end - if Karl joins in

  * Auth? i kinda like the idea of anyone using this when its ready. people like to keep track of what media they own and what theyve read/watched if they dont own it. it always sucks to get a new book that sounds really interesting, only to realize a little ways in that youve already read it
  
probably different media types: 

  * [books](models/books.md)
  
  * [movies](models/movies.md)
  
  * [tv shows]()
  
  * [anime](models/anime.md)
  
different models(or maybe an interface?) for each one
